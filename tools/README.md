# Tools for Survey Strategy White Paper Writers

This folder contains some notebooks to help support people writing cadence white papers in fall 2018. 

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [BasicNvisitsAreaTrade.ipynb](BasicNvisitsAreaTrade) | This notebook demos how to evaluate the total number of fields in an area, split a typical number of available visits per field, divide those visits by filter per field, and then calculate the approximate coadded depth expected per filter per field. |
| [ExposureTimesForConstantDepth.ipynb](ExposureTimesForConstantDepth) | Evaluate the typical range of single visit depth in WFD in a baseline style survey, then evaluate how many exposures would be required to really keep constant depth. Then evaluate expected range in single visit depth if exposure time varied between 20-60s per visit. Also evaluates mean/median/mode of typical WFD visits. |
